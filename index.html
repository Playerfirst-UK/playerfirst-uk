                    <div class="panel-body" style="background-color:#000">
                        Brian is the former Tottenham Hotspur, Brentford and Gillingham defender who
                        also represented England at u20 and u21 level.
                        <br><br>
                        Brian worked under a number of renowned managers throughout his career,
                        including Terry Venables, Harry Redknapp, Tony Pulis and David Pleat,
                        gaining valuable experience and an insight from each of them. After 12 years
                        as a professional footballer Brian retired due to persistent injuries, and
                        pursued a career in the City. In 2000 he gained the relevant qualifications
                        and became a successful Stockbroker, advising high net worth and private
                        clients. After seven years Collins Sarri Statham Investments was established
                        and is now a well respected, award winning Stockbrokers.
                        <br><br>
                        Brian has a wealth of experience, contacts and knowledge from the worlds of football
                        and finance. This will enable PlayerFirst to provide first class advice to
                        footballers during their playing careers and importantly when their playing days are over.
                        <br><br>
                        Brian says "Becoming a successful footballer takes many years of dedication,
                        sacrifice, thousands of hours of hard work and a slice of luck. With that
                        success comes the financial rewards, however the hardest part about being
                        successful and wealthy is staying successful and wealthy. When you career
                        finishes you still have a lifetime to live, so looking after your wealth
                        never became so important"
                        <br><br>

                        Chris started working in the financial sector in 1990. He began his career
                        in the trading pits on the London International Financial Futures Exchange,
                        'Liffe'. He started working for Citibank, moved to Barclays, and then executed
                        business for J.P.Morgan. He then went on to forge a career as an independent
                        trader, where he would trade his own capital. The 'floor' as it became
                        known was a predominantly male environment, where only the mentally strong survived.
                        <br><br>
                        In 1990, Liffe closed it's trading pits in favour of a new screen based trading
                        platform. Chris saw this as an opportunity to open a trading office to facilitate
                        the traders. He has been running this successfully for the last 16 years.
                        <br><br>
                        When recently asked what stands Playerfirst apart from other agents, Chris
                        replied "at Playerfirst we are not just looking to help players with their
                        transfers but with every aspect of their lives. Most agents will just want
                        to do 'the transfer'. At PlayerFirst we realise the importance of sorting
                        out a player's personal affairs, so they can concentrate on their football."
                        <br><br>
                        Chris is married with four children and enjoys supporting them in their sporting
                        and academic activities. He also enjoys Football, Skiing and Shooting.
