    TRACK ATHLETES:

    Ashliegh Nelson (GB Int-sprinter-PR 11.19s European Bronze Medellist 2014).

    reduced the risk and limitation of long term sustainable injures. These athletes have been able to develop strength,
    sprint faster, jump higher, durable on the pitch and change direction efficiently for optimum performance. The
    programmes designed will be specific to the individual as required by the testing protocols.
